# Driving-School

Presentation website for a fictional driving school company

### How did it start

It started as a simple, brochure website for a drivning school using only html and css. But since i had many ideas that could not fit only in one page,
i decided to create 3 more pages and include javaScript for animations and an exteranl api

### Technologies used
HTML5, CSS3, javaScript (ES6)
